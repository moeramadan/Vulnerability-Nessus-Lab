# Vulnerability Management Lab

## Overview:
This project entails establishing and executing a comprehensive Vulnerability Management Lab, featuring a Windows 11 Virtual Machine (VM) and Nessus, a robust vulnerability scanning tool. Through a series of scans, this project demonstrates the efficacy of vulnerability assessment, remediation, and verification. It underscores the critical importance of proactively managing and securing systems in real-world scenarios.

## Steps:
### Preliminary Vulnerability Assessment:
   - Conducted an initial scan of the Windows 11 VM without specific login credentials to obtain an overview of potential vulnerabilities.

### Comprehensive Credentialed Scan:
   - Performed a second scan with login credentials, enabling Nessus to conduct a more thorough assessment of the VM's security posture.

### Introduction of Controlled Vulnerabilities:
   - Deliberately introduced vulnerabilities by installing an outdated version of Firefox on the Windows 11 VM, simulating real-world scenarios where vulnerabilities can be inadvertently introduced or exploited.

### Vulnerability Mitigation:
   - Identified and remediated vulnerabilities by updating the outdated Firefox installation and implementing other necessary security measures.

### Final Validation Scan:
   - Conducted a final scan to validate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts, ensuring that vulnerabilities were successfully mitigated and system security was enhanced.


## Tools Used:
- VMware
- Nessus

### Step 3: Introduce Further Vulnerabilities:
   - Enable remote registry, turn off user account control, turn on file and printer sharing, and download an outdated version of Mozilla Firefox onto the Windows 11 VM to scan the device with known vulnerabilities.
